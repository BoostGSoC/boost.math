Project details
--------------------------------------------------------

This project adds several new files to the existing file structure
of Boost.Math. These new files contain the implementations of
several new functions. These include Bernoulli numbers, extension
of tgamma and lgamma to high precision, and polygamma.

Upon successful completion of the project, the candidate files
in this project may potentially be merged to and/or included
in Boost.Math.

Using this project with Boost
--------------------------------------------------------

The files in this project can be used with an existing Boost trunk
or distribution of Boost. Do note, however, that at the time this
project is being written, the files require the Boost trunk in
order to compile.

The way to use these files is to include the base directory of this
project in the "C++ way" upstream of the rgeular inclusion of the
Boost distribution or trunk.
